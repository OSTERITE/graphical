This is a small project i am working on for fun, whilst also trying to learn how to use github.

This project is a webpage, where you can change some simple variables to create an image drawn on a html canvas.
I recommend checking out the bottom of the script for expressions which can be used to make cool images that i 
have discovered after trying random expressions.

Thanks for reading üëç
